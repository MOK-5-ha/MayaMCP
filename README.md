# MayaMCP

Originally created as a capstone project for Kaggle's Gen AI Intensive Course Q1 2025. Meant to demonstrate the skills in generative AI we've learned over the course of a week with a project of our own choosing that utilized at least 5 of those skills. Had 16 days to complete it.<br><br>

After obtaining our Gen AI certificates from completing and submitting the first version of our service-working AI agent, we sought to complete it. Here in June, Gradio & Huggingface are holding an Agents & MCP hackathon, with multiple AI inference engine & foundation labs participating in the way of providing participants with free credits to build with throughout the duration of the competition.<br><br>

So now this project has taken to the MCP turn. Where Anthropic's new protocol is taking the AI development by storm, creating yet another new paradigm is this ever accelerating industry.

This second iteration of Maya, our AI agent, will be bolstered with the power of MCP, open-source AI frameworks, and hardware accelerators. Leaving behind the Google-based vendor lock-in it's initial iteration had with Gemini serving at it's base.
