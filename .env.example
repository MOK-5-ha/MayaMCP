# Maya Configuration (.env)
# -------------------------
# Note: Maya uses BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) mode. Users typically provide
# API keys through the UI. These variables are only used as fallbacks if
# the session state is unavailable.

# Model Configuration
GEMINI_MODEL_VERSION=gemini-3-flash-preview
TEMPERATURE=1.0  # Optimized for Gemini 3 Flash reasoning
MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=2048

# FastAPI Configuration
PORT=8000
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Environment Configuration
PYTHON_ENV=development  # Options: development, production, testing
# Set DEBUG=True only for local troubleshooting; always False in production.
DEBUG=False

# Security
# [CRITICAL] Master key for encrypting sensitive session data (like user API keys).
# Generate a secure key using: 
# python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
# 
# WARNING: If left empty, a temporary ephemeral key is generated on startup.
# All encrypted session data will be UNRECOVERABLE if the application restarts,
# which will disrupt active user sessions in production.
#
# RECOMMENDATION: Generate this key once and persist it securely (e.g., in a 
# secrets manager or environment store). Ensure the key is stored safely and 
# rotated according to your security policy.
